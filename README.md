# Misc.-Scripts

## plexstats.sh
This script was an edit of a script made by [ajkis](https://github.com/ajkis/scripts/blob/master/plex/plex-library-stats.sh).
It also utilizes some sql commands written by [bbobrian](https://www.reddit.com/user/bbobrian) [[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/gnuz9c/cpu_usage_to_generate_intro_video_markers_on_8700/frdejds/)].
If there are any changes you'd like to see let me know.
